        My main goal for my time at Carnegie was to learn what a real software development job would be like.
        With respect to a real job, I learned how to express my progress and hangups during stand-up meetings,
        how team management techniques are applied in practice, and that customer requirements aren't always
        clear.

        Another goal I had was to learn as many technologies as I could. I exceeded my highest expectations
        with the number and depth of my learning these past 8 months. I gained lots of experience designing,
        writing, and maintaining node.js applications. I also learned about event-loop and callback based
        programming, something which was completely alien to me when I began. I also learned about different
        database types like noSQL vs SQL and some tips on when you choose each. Furthermore I learned about
        interprocess communication (IPC) methods like Berkeley sockets and RabbitMQ. I was also happy to
        learn how to use CMake properly in a large project -- no more manual Makefiles!

        A hard learned rule is 'hardware integration is not trivial'. I though assembling a new generation
        of IoT devices wouldn't be too difficult; everything is consumer components -- it should be plug
        and play! As is often the case with integration testing, things to not always go as planned.
        Don't be afraid to dive deep into the Linux kernel source, email maintainers, and scotch tape over
        a few connector contacts. :)

        One of the technologies that I'm most excited to learn about is Docker; a program containerization
        system. After seeing how Docker is applied to Carnegie's services, I have been adding docker
        support to all my new projects and some open source projects.

        I worked with some very smart people who were generous enough to let me tag along to architectural
        design meetings and explain why they made their technical choices. I don't think I could design a
        similarly large system as effectively as they could, but I think I have a much better intuition now.
        I'm almost in awe at how smart my coworkers were, and I hope I have learned some of their skill
        through osmosis.

        I used to think I was moderately competent in git, but now I feel 20 times more capable.
        I also don't think I will ever forget how 'git rebase' works for as long as I live. :)

        I learned to value code reviews more once I internalized that one of my co-workers had to stop
        what they were otherwise doing to evaluate and understand what I wrote. I realize now that
        reviews are valuable and should not be wasted with easy to catch mistakes. When the reviewer
        knows that you consider their review valuable, they are likely to do your review sooner.

    - mediaType: Paragraph
      mediaText: |+
        Once I started writing down exactly the things I had accomplished, I realized how many things
        I forget I even worked on. Preparing what you have to say before stand-ups helped reduce
        my meeting times and improve the communication within the team. As a result I donâ€™t have to focus
        on what I have to say during the meeting, and instead can focus on what my coworkers are saying.
        This helped my better understand the overall system that we were working on.

      mediaText: Be more involved in project design
    - mediaType: Paragraph
      mediaText: |+
        I improved my involvement in project meetings by attending additional meetings like sprint
        planning meetings. There I could see the tasks that needed to be done during the sprint and
        which tasks where still left to do. While there I learned the reasons why the team had to
        switch database systems during a critical time in development.
